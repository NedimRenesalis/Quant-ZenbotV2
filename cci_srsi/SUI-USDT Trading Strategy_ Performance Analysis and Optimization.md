## Key Recommendations

1. **Use Market-Adaptive Configuration**: Implement the market-adaptive configuration that dynamically adjusts parameters based on detected market conditions for optimal performance across varying market scenarios.

2. **Implement Enhanced Risk Management**: Add dynamic stop loss, time-based position management, volume filtering, and adaptive position sizing to improve risk-adjusted returns.

3. **Validate with Comprehensive Backtesting**: Use the provided backtesting script to validate performance across different market conditions and parameter sets before deploying to production.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor performance metrics and be prepared to adjust parameters as market conditions evolve.

5. **Consider a Balanced Approach**: If the market-adaptive approach is too complex initially, the balanced configuration provides a good compromise between trading frequency and risk management.

The comprehensive backtesting script provides a framework for validating these recommendations and fine-tuning parameters based on actual historical performance.
