# Iteration 1: Performance Expectations Analysis

## Trade Frequency Estimation

Based on the strategy configuration and SUI-USDT market characteristics:

### Factors Affecting Trade Frequency
- **Timeframe**: 3-minute candles (very short timeframe)
- **Signal Generation**: Multiple confirmation mechanisms (CCI, SRSI, divergence)
- **Market State Classification**: Different handling for sideways, trending, and volatile markets
- **Confirmation Requirements**: Requires 1+ periods of confirmation (configurable)
- **SUI-USDT Volatility**: ~8% intraday volatility (relatively high)

### Estimated Trade Frequency
- **Daily Trades**: 15-25 trades per day
  - 480 three-minute candles per day (24 hours)
  - Signal generation on approximately 5-8% of candles
  - Additional filtering from confirmation requirements and market state handling
- **Trade Distribution**: Higher concentration during volatile market hours
- **Average Trade Duration**: 15-45 minutes (5-15 candles)

## Win Rate Estimation

### Factors Affecting Win Rate
- **Multiple Confirmation Mechanisms**: Improves signal quality
- **Market State Classification**: Adapts strategy to current conditions
- **Divergence Detection**: Identifies higher-probability reversal points
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjusts based on current volatility
- **Stop Loss Implementation**: Fixed 0.4% stop loss may lead to frequent stop-outs

### Estimated Win Rate
- **Overall Win Rate**: 55-60%
  - Higher in trending markets (60-65%)
  - Lower in sideways or choppy markets (50-55%)
  - Reduced during extreme volatility (45-50%)
- **Profit/Loss Ratio**: Approximately 1.2:1
  - 0.4% stop loss
  - 0.8% take profit
  - Trailing stop helps capture occasional larger moves

## Maximum Drawdown Estimation

### Factors Affecting Maximum Drawdown
- **Fixed Stop Loss**: 0.4% per trade limits individual trade losses
- **Position Sizing**: Risk-based sizing (1% of capital per trade)
- **Correlation Between Trades**: No explicit handling for correlated positions
- **Market Condition Filters**: Prevents trading during extreme volatility

### Estimated Maximum Drawdown
- **Expected Maximum Drawdown**: 4-6% of account
  - Based on probability of consecutive losing trades
  - Assumes proper position sizing implementation
  - Considers potential for correlated losses in trending markets
- **Worst-Case Scenario**: 8-10% drawdown during extreme market conditions
  - Flash crashes or black swan events
  - Execution slippage beyond expected levels
  - API failures during critical market movements

## Sharpe Ratio Estimation (Daily)

### Factors Affecting Sharpe Ratio
- **Expected Return**: Based on win rate, profit/loss ratio, and trade frequency
- **Return Volatility**: Consistency of returns across different market conditions
- **Risk-Free Rate**: Minimal impact in current environment

### Estimated Daily Sharpe Ratio
- **Expected Daily Sharpe**: 1.2-1.5
  - Assumes 15-25 trades per day
  - Average daily return: 0.6-0.9%
  - Daily return standard deviation: 0.4-0.7%
- **Annualized Sharpe**: 19-24
  - Calculated as daily Sharpe * sqrt(252)
  - Likely optimistic due to auto-correlation in daily returns

## First Iteration Conclusions

Based on the first iteration of analysis, the strategy shows promising performance expectations with moderate trade frequency, a positive win rate, controlled drawdown, and a favorable Sharpe ratio. However, these estimates are theoretical and would need validation through proper backtesting.

The relatively high trade frequency (15-25 trades per day) combined with a moderate win rate (55-60%) suggests the strategy could generate consistent returns, but the tight stop loss (0.4%) may lead to frequent stop-outs in a volatile market like SUI-USDT.

The next iteration will focus on refining these estimates based on deeper analysis of the strategy logic and potential market scenarios.
